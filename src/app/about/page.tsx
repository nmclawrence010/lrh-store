      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">What is Homeopathy?</h1>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Homeopathy is a natural, safe, gentle yet very powerful and effective 
        medical system used successfully for over 200 years in many countries 
        around the world. Homeopathic medicine is the fastest growing method 
        of health care in the world used by hundreds of millions and is growing 
        annually. It is based on the principle of treating like with like which 
        basically means that a substance that can cause a certain disease, 
        ailment, injury or emotional state has the ability to cure and address 
        those problems when given in lesser doses. 
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Homeopathy is an individualised 
        method of healing and as a professional Homeopathic practitioner I will 
        take each case based on the individuality of each patient giving 
        meticulous consideration to all symptoms both physical and emotional. 
        A full and complete history is taken so that the correct medicine can 
        be prescribed to achieve the best results. Many chronic and refractory 
        diseases can respond to homeopathic treatment, particularly where 
        conventional medication may have failed. Injuries, acute, chronic 
        illnesses and emotionally related problems also respond well.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">My work and what I do</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        I am a Professional Homeopathic Practitioner with a very busy and 
        successful practice. My work consists of Homeopathic consultations 
        by means of my clinic, online and telephone consultation as I have 
        people all around the world seeking my help and treatments. I have 
        also worked on the best possible Homeopathic formulas for many common 
        conditions for both people and animals, all of which are available 
        from the online store. Whilst many common ailments can be treated 
        acutely there are many conditions that will need a full consultation. 
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I have also worked with animals for many years both in the healing 
        and rescue capacity. I started a charity called Lurcher Lifeline 
        which later became Animal Lifeline as other breeds were coming through 
        our doors. I have worked with some amazing people to help with the 
        rescue, rehabilitation, recovery and rehoming of many animals. I have 
        had the greatest pleasure to be able to see so many positive changes 
        in so many of the animals treated with Homeopathic medicine. I have 
        an excellent success rate with rescue dogs with many emotional issues 
        related to their traumatic past. Over recent years I have become well 
        known and respected in the Sighthound community worldwide for various 
        treatments for many conditions. My work extends to all breeds and 
        other animals too.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Homeopathy for Animals</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Homeopathy has been used for animals for at least 200 years. There is 
        great success in the use of Homeopathy for animals. It is the most 
        gentle and natural way to treat our pets without any unwanted or toxic 
        side effects and can treat many conditions, physical and emotional. I 
        have achieved great success with both. Homeopathic medicines stimulate 
        the animal's immune system and the bodies own healing ability to achieve 
        a speedier recovery and sense of well being again on all levels. 
        Homeopathic medicines are carefully selected according to the individual 
        problem and have the ability to stimulate natural healing processes in 
        the animal patient.

        All types of animals respond - from dogs, cats etc to farm animals; from 
        horses to wild animals; from birds to fish. Organic farmers rely upon 
        homeopathic medicine as an effective, safe medicine which does not give 
        rise to drug residues in meat, milk or eggs. Conventional farmers also 
        make use of its benefits. We have run modern intensive farms with 
        veterinary homeopathy, without the use of antibiotics, hormones and 
        other drugs, showing its true capability as being a very effective and 
        curative system of medicine.

        What does a homeopathic consultation involve?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        A Homeopath will take a full account of your symptoms and will carefully 
        listen to how you are feeling and how you would like to feel. It is 
        important to have a clear understanding of all your symptoms and feelings, 
        how they affect you, your energy levels, your current, past and family 
        medical history. Each person is so different and this is why a Homeopath 
        takes such an individualised approach to each case. Anything you tell 
        your Homeopath will be treated with the strictest confidence. Based on 
        all the information your Homeopath will decide which homeopathic medicine 
        best suits you and will start you on treatment. The first consultation 
        will last approximately 1 hour 30 minutes with regular follow up 
        appointments lasting 1 hour.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Consultations can be arranged at my clinic, online and telephone consultation.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Your Homeopath will take time to listen and help you achieve good health, 
        positive change and an overall sense of well being.
